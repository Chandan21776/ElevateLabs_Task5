Task 5: Train-Test Split & Evaluation Metrics
This task demonstrates how a dataset is divided into training and testing sets, how a simple Logistic Regression model is trained, and how its performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix. It helps understand model evaluation fundamentals and performance interpretation.

🎯Final Outcome
Intern gains a strong understanding of model training, data splitting, performance metrics, and classification evaluation concepts.
